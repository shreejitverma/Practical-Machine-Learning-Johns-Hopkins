Question 01
-----------  
Which of the following are steps in building a machine learning algorithm?  
* Machine learning.  
* Artificial intelligence.  
* Statistical inference.  
* Collecting data to answer the question.  

### Answer  
* Collecting data to answer the question.  

Question 02
-----------  
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?  
* We are not asking a relevant question that can be answered with machine learning.  
* We have too few predictors to get good out of sample accuracy.  
* We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance.  
* Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.  

### Answer  
* Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.  

Question 03  
-----------  
What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?  
* 90% training set, 10% test set.  
* 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.  
* 80% training set, 20% test set.  
* 10% test set, 90% training set.  

### Answer  
* 60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.  

Question 04
-----------  
What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didn't click)?  
* Median absolute deviation.  
* P-values.  
* R^2.  
* Predictive value of a positive.  

### Answer  
* Predictive value of a positive.  

Question 05
-----------  
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?  
* 9 %.  
* 50 %.  
* 99 %.  
* 90 %.  

### Answer  
* 9 %.
